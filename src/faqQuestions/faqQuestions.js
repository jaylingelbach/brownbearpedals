    summary: 'Do your pedals ship with power supply units? (PSU) ?',
    details: `Our pedals do not ship with power supply units. Importantly
    they also do not have the ability to run off a 9v battery either. You will 
    need to power these with a suitable (preferably isolated) 9v PSU that is 
    intended for guitar pedal power only.`

    summary: 'My pedal started having a noise problem',
    details: `Has anything else in the signal chain changed? Many noise problems
    are due to an inferior power supply. Have you tried it by itself? 
    When troubleshooting itâ€™s best to isolate the assumed source. 
    Have you tried it with different cables? 
    Are you using the gain channel of your amp or clean channel? 
    Most higher gain pedals sound best into the clean channel of an amp.`

{
    summary: 'What are the power requirements for your pedals?',
    details: `We advise you use a good quality power supply for your pedals. Each pedal was designed to run at 9v DC and
     will perform as designed when being run that way. Also, ensure that your 
    power supply is a negative center pin.`
